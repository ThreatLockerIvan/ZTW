# Metasploit CTF
Welcome to the Guided Capture The Flag (CTF) experience! In this hands-on session, you will delve into the world of penetration testing guided by our specially crafted Matesploit class. Our aim is to provide an interactive journey through the intricate steps of a penetration test, utilizing real-world scenarios and tools. In this class we will cover the folowing topics:

### Enumeration

#### Tools:
- **Nmap:** Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It helps in identifying hosts and services on a network.

- **Gobuster:** Gobuster is a tool designed to brute-force directories and files within web servers. It's commonly used to discover hidden content and identify vulnerabilities in web applications.

### Exploitation

#### Tools:
- **Metasploit:** Metasploit is a widely-used penetration testing framework that makes it easier to find, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities in systems. It provides a large collection of exploits, payloads, and auxiliary modules.

- **John the Ripper:** John the Ripper is a popular password-cracking tool used to perform dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks against hashed passwords. It's efficient in cracking various types of password hashes.

### Privilege Escalation

#### Tool:
- **Linpeas:** Linpeas is a Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Script designed to automate the process of privilege escalation on Linux systems. It performs thorough system enumeration to identify potential paths for privilege escalation.
