# **Pwn To Own Challenge Write Up**
This is the complete guild to the Pwn To Own Challenge for Zero Trust World
2024\. If you had problems with the challenge or had no time and want to know
the answers this is the spot.  It would be too long to put both write
ups in one file so they are split into two files.
